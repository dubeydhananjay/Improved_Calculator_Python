This Python code defines a Calculator class that provides a simple interface for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on Decimal numbers. The class uses static methods, demonstrating a functional approach within an object-oriented context. 
Each operation method creates a Calculation object, performs the calculation, adds it to a history of calculations, and then returns the result. 
This project demonstrates effective use of object-oriented and functional programming principles to create a modular, maintainable, and easy-to-use calculator interface.

This project contains tests for the calculator using pytest and pylint.
The tests are designed to verify the correctness of basic arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) implemented in the calculator.operations module,
as well as the functionality of the Calculation class that encapsulates these operations.
